- Updated all hypermedia libraries to their latest versions:
  - HTMX and all HTMX extensions
  - Alpine.js and Alpine AJAX

- Maintained backward compatibility for all existing functionality

# 3.0.1 / 2025-08-30
- Released on [wp.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/api-for-htmx/).

# 3.0.0 / 2025-08-21
- **NEW:** **HyperBlocks** - Sane PHP-based block creation system, no JavaScript required, with **two complementary approaches**
  - **Fluent API**: PHP-only block development.
  - **block.json**: WordPress-standard JSON blocks.
  - **Unified Editor**: Both approaches use the same React editor component for consistent UX.
  - **Zero JavaScript**: Build complex Gutenberg blocks using only PHP.
- **NEW:** **HyperFields** - PHP-based field creation system, no JavaScript required, for use with Gutenberg blocks, metaboxes and custom option pages.
- **NEW:** Auto-discovery system for blocks in `/hyperblocks/` directories
- **NEW:** Server-side rendering engine with secure PHP template execution

- **BREAKING CHANGE:** The project's namespace has been updated from `HMApi` to `HyperPress` for clarity and branding. All public-facing helper functions have been renamed from `hm_` to `hp_`. Key constants and nonce identifiers have also been updated (`HMAPI_ABSPATH` is now `HYPERPRESS_ABSPATH`, and `hmapi_nonce` is now `hyperpress_nonce`). A backward-compatibility layer has been included to minimize disruption (ex: HyperPress provides alias for old now-deprecated functions). However, a major version bump was required to signal significant changes on new HyperPress v3.

# 2.0.7 / 2025-08-02
- **IMPROVEMENT:** Added a `hyperpress/before_template_load` action hook that fires before each hypermedia template partial is loaded, providing a centralized point for common template preparation logic. Thanks @eduwass.
- **FIX:** Added `stripslashes_deep()` to the `hm_ds_read_signals()` function to remove WordPress "magic quotes" slashes from GET requests, ensuring proper JSON decoding for Datastar signals. Thanks @eduwass.
- Updated Datastar JS library to the latest version.
- Updated Datastar PHP SDK to the latest version.

# 2.0.6 / 2025-07-23
- **FIX:** Updated Datastar.js enqueue to use `wp_enqueue_script_module()` for proper ES module support (WordPress 6.5+). Thanks @eduwass for the report.

# 2.0.5 / 2025-07-11
- **NEW:** Added a suite of Datastar helper functions (`hm_ds_*`) to simplify working with Server-Sent Events (SSE), including functions for patching elements, managing signals, and executing scripts.
- **IMPROVEMENT:** The admin settings page now dynamically displays tabs based on the selected active library (HTMX, Alpine Ajax, or Datastar), reducing UI clutter.
- **REFACTOR:** Centralized plugin option management by introducing a `getOptions()` method in the main plugin class.
- **REFACTOR:** Improved the structure of the admin options page for better maintainability and separation of concerns.

# 1.3.0 / 2025-05-11
- Updated HTMX, HTMX extensions, Hyperscript and Alpine.js to their latest versions.
- Added the ability to use this plugin as a library, using composer. This allows you to use HTMX in your own plugins or themes, without the need to install this plugin. The plugin/library will determine if a greater instance of itself is already loaded. If so, it will use that instance. Otherwise, it will load a new one. So, no issues with multiple instances of the same library on different plugins or themes.
- Added a new way to load different HTMX templates path, using the filter `hxwp/register_template_path`. This allows you to register a new template path for your plugin or theme, without overriding the default template path, or stepping on the toes of other plugins or themes that may be using the same template path. This is useful if you want to use HTMX in your own plugin or theme, without having to worry about conflicts with other plugins or themes.
- Introduced a colon (`:`) as the explicit separator for namespaced template paths (e.g., `my-plugin:path/to/template`). This provides a clear distinction between plugin/theme-specific templates and templates in the active theme's default `htmx-templates` directory. Requests for explicitly namespaced templates that are not found will result in a 404 and will not fall back to the theme's default directory.
- Now using PSR-4 autoloading for the plugin's code.
