Supercharge WordPress with Hypermedia. Build interactive blocks & pages with Datastar, HTMX or Alpine Ajax—all using simple PHP. No JS required.

== Description ==
Supercharge WordPress with the power of hypermedia. Use Datastar, HTMX or Alpine Ajax to create rich, interactive blocks and pages—all with the simplicity of PHP. No JavaScript required.

Hypermedia is a concept that extends the idea of hypertext by allowing for more complex interactions and data representations. It enables the use of AJAX, WebSockets, and Server-Sent Events directly in HTML using attributes, without writing any JavaScript. It reuses an "old" concept, [Hypermedia](https://hypermedia.systems/), to handle the modern web in a more HTML-like and natural way.
